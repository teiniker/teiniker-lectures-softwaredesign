# Software Design 

Software design is a process in which software developers create a plan for
a software solution. This plan outlines the overall structure and behavior 
of the software, focusing on how the system will meet the requirements 
specified in the software requirements phase. 


## Design Activities

The design process includes several key activities:

* **Architectural Design**: This is the highest level of design which defines 
    the overall structure of the system, typically involving major components   
    and their interactions. It establishes the framework for developing the system.

    See: [Software Architectures by Example](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarearchitectures) 

* **Detailed Design**: This involves more fine-grained planning of specific 
    components of the system. It details the operations, parameters, and how 
    different components interact with each other. This phase also specifies 
    the logical structure of each module and their interfaces.

* **Database Design**: In applications that involve data storage, database 
    design is crucial. It involves defining the data structures, storage format, 
    and how data is accessed and managed within the system.

* **User Interface Design**: This focuses on how users will interact with the 
    software, designing the look and feel, the layout of the interface, and 
    ensuring user experience and usability are optimized.

Software design is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle 
because it directly impacts the quality, maintainability, and scalability 
of the final product. 

A well-thought-out design can **reduce complexity**, minimize the risk of 
errors, and ensure the system is flexible enough to accommodate future changes. 
Additionally, it serves as a blueprint for developers, guiding the implementation 
phase and helping ensure that the final product aligns with the intended design 
and requirements.


## Design vs. Testing

There is a significant relationship between the design of software systems and 
the testing of these systems. The design phase directly influences how testing 
is approached, planned, and executed. 

Ways in which software design impacts testing:

* **Testability**: A primary consideration in software design is ensuring that 
    the system is testable. Good design practices include defining clear interfaces, 
    maintaining low coupling between components, and high cohesion within components, 
    which make it easier to test individual parts (unit testing) and their 
    interactions (integration testing).

* **Testing Early in the Lifecycle**: The design of a software system can 
    facilitate early testing, such as unit testing and integration testing. 
    Early detection of design flaws or misunderstandings about system behavior 
    can prevent costly fixes later in the development lifecycle.

* **Automated Testing**: A well-designed system lends itself more easily to automated 
    testing. By designing systems with automation in mind, such as by incorporating 
    features that allow easy control and observation of their state, developers can 
    facilitate more efficient and effective testing practices.

* **Regression Testing**: Changes in software design during the development process 
    (Refactoring) or in subsequent updates can introduce new defects. Regression testing, 
    which involves re-testing the unchanged parts of the application to ensure they still 
    work as expected after changes, is influenced by how well the design is documented 
    and how modular it is.

The relationship between design and testing in software systems is integral. Effective 
design enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of testing, while poor design can 
complicate testing efforts and may lead to higher costs and increased risk of failure. 

**Design decisions should always consider their impact on the testability of the system**.
