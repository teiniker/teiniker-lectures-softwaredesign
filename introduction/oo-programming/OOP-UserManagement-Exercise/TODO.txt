Exercise: Implementing a Class Diagram
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the class diagram, implement the following classes in Java:

A) User
    The class "User" has the attributes: id:int, username:String, and
    password:string.
    Implement the constructor, the getter and setter methods, hashCode()
    and equals() as well as toString().
    "User" also has an association of multiplicity 1 to the class "Group".

B) Group
    The class "Group" has the attributes: id:int, and name:String.
    Implement the constructor, the getter and setter methods, hashCode()
    and equals() as well as toString().
    "Group" also has an association of multiplicity * to the class "User".

C) Refactoring
    To reduce the code redundancy, implement a base class called "Entity"
    which implements the common id:int attribute together with the getter
    and setter methods, hashCode and equals.

Tip: Use the "UserTest" and "GroupTest" classes to verify your implementations.
