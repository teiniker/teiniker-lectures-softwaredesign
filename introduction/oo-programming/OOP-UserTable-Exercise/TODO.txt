Exercise: Implementing a Class Diagram
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the class diagram, implement the following classes in Java:

A) User
    The class "User" has the attributes: "id:int", "username:String", and
    "password:string".
    Implement the constructor, the getter and setter methods, hashCode()
    and equals() as well as toString().
    "User" also has an association of multiplicity * to the class "Mail".

B) Mail
    The class "Mail" has the attribute: "address:String".
    Implement the constructor, the getter and setter methods, hashCode()
    and equals() as well as toString().
    "Mail" also has an association of multiplicity 1 to the class "User".
	
C) UserTable
    Write an interface called "UserTable" which defines the following
    operations:
	* void insertUser(User u)
	    Insert a User object into the table.
	* User findById(int id)
	    Find a User object with the given id (or return null)
	* List<User> findAll()
	    Return a List of stored User objects.

D) IntegerSequence
    Implement a class "IntegerSequence" with the following static methods:
    * void setInitValue(int initValue)
        Set the static field "value" to the given "initValue" (default value
        of "value" is 1).
    * int getNextValue()
        Return the current "value" and increment "value" by 1.
    This "IntegerSequence" can be used to generate unique "id" values for
    "User" objects during the "insert()" operation of the "UserTable".

E) UserTableImpl
    Write a class called "UserTableImpl" which implements the "UserTable"
    interface and all its methods.
    Use an ArrayList<User> to implement the table internally.

F) Admin
    Inherit a class called "Admin" from "User".
    Add an additional attribute: "rootPassword:String".

Tip: Use the "UserTest" and "UserTableTest" classes to verify your implementations.
