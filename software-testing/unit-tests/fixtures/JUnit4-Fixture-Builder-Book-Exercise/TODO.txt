Exercise: Fixture Builder - Book
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a working test class named "BookTest".

A) Fixture Builder
    Implement a "BookBuilder" class which uses a fluent interface to
    build a "Book" instance.
    Example:
		Book book = new BookBuilder()
				.isbn("9780132350884")
				.author("Robert C. Martin")
				.title("Clean Code")
				.build();

B) Refactor Test Class
    Refactor the "BookTest" class to only use the "BookBuilder" to
    create instances of "Book".

    At the same time, try to reduce duplicated code in this test class
    as well.

Make sure that after your refactorings all tests are still working!
