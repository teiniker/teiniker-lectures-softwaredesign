Exercise: Code Coverage
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For the given classes "Blog", "Post" and "IntegerSequence", implement
the following test classes:
	IntegerSequenceTest
	PostTest
	BlogTest
	
Note that you will need a test stub named "PostTableStub" for the 
given "PostTable" interface.

Build the test cases so that a 100% code coverage (line coverage) is 
reached.
