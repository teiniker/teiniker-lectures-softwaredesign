Exercise: Result Verification - Book
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a class named "Book" which should be tested by "BookTest".
Implement the missing helper methods:

A) boolean equals(Book expected, Book actual)
    Compares every single attribute of the two "Book" objects.
    Returns only "true" if all attributes are equal.

B) void assertEquals(Book expected, Book actual)
    Uses "Assert.assertEquals()" methods to compare every attribute
    of the "expected" object with the "actual" object.
    Because of using the "assertEquals()" methods, we know exactly
    which attribute is not equal.
