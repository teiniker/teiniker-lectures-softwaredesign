Exercise: record - Message
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement an immutable class called `Message` as a record 
with the following additional features:

A) Input Validation 
In the constructor, ensure that `id` is positive and
`data` is not `null`.

B) Deep Copy 
In the getter method data() and the constructor, implement a deep copy
so that only a copy of the private list is provided.

Test you implementation with the given `MessageTest` class.
