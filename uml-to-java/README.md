# Object-Oriented Modelling

A **class** is a descriptor for a set of objects that share the same attributes, 
operations, methods, relationships and behavior.

An **object** is a discrete entity with a well-defined boundary that encapsulates 
state and behavior.

**Classification** is possibly the single most important way that human beings have 
of ordering information about the world.
Classes allow us to describe the set of features that every object of the class must 
have without having to describe every one of those objects.
Given that there are so many options, choosing the most appropriate classification 
scheme is one of the most important aspects of object-oriented analysis and design.

The **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is a family of graphical notations, backed 
by a single meta-model, that help in describing and designing software systems.

While UML diagrams are independent of any programming language, we can 
**define a mapping between UML and Java**.
The following examples show the connection between UML diagrams and their implementation
in Java.
