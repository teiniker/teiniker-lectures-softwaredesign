# Introduction to Design Patterns

> “Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, 
> and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you 
> can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.”
> (Christopher Alexander, 1977)

A pattern has four essential elements:

* The **pattern name** is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, 
    and consequences in a word or two. Naming a pattern immediately increases our design 
    vocabulary.

* The **problem** describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its 
    context. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions that must be met 
    before it makes sense to apply the pattern.

* The **solution** describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, 
    responsibilities, and collaborations.
    The solution doesn’t describe a particular concrete design or implementation, because 
    the pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.

* The **consequences** are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. They are 
    critical for evaluating design alternatives.
