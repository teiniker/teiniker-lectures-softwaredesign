# Factory Method

> Define an **interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate**. 
> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


## Applicability

* A class canâ€™t anticipate the class of objects it must create.

* Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want 
    to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.


## Structure

![Class Diagram](figures/ClassDiagram-FactoryMethod.jpg)


* `Product`: Defines the interface of objects.

* `ConcreteProduct`: Implements the `Product` interface.

* `Creator`: Declares the factory method, which returns an object of type `Product`.
    May also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default `ConcreteProduct` 
    object.


## Consequences

* A potential disadvantage of factory methods is that **clients might have to subclass the Creator class** 
    just to create a particular `ConcreteProduct` object.

* Factory methods are **defined as part of an interface** and are not bound to the implementation 
    class like the constructor.


## Implementation Issues

* The two main **variations** of the factory method pattern are:
    * **Creator** is an **interface** or abstract class.
    * **Creator** is a **concrete class** and provides a default implementation for the factory method.

* The factory method takes a **parameter that identifies the kind of object to create**. All 
    objects the factory method creates will share the `Product` interface. Overriding a parameterized 
    factory method lets you easily and selectively extend or change the products that `Creator` produces.
