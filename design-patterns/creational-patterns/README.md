# Creational Patterns

Here's an example showing the **limitations of the class constructor**:
* [ReplaceConstructorWithCreationMethod](ReplaceConstructorWithCreationMethod)

Creational design patterns **abstract the instantiation process**.
They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, 
and represented.

Creational patterns help to **separate business logic from creational logic**,
therefore, they **reduce the number of dependencies between classes**.
