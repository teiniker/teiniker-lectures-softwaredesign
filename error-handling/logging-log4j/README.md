# Log4j2

Inserting log requests into the application code requires a fair amount of planning and effort. 

Observation shows that approximately 4 percent of code is dedicated to logging. Consequently, even 
moderately sized applications will have thousands of logging statements embedded within their code. 
Given their number, it becomes imperative to manage these log statements without the need to modify 
them manually.

## Essential Log4j2 Configuration

Log4j has a **default configuration**: It will log to the console, showing messages classified as
